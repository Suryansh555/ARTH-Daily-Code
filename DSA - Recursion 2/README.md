## Easy – Difficulty: Powerset

Write a function that takes in an array of unique integers and returns its
powerset. The powerset P(X) of a set X is the set of all subsets of X. For
example, the powerset of [1,2] is [[], [1], [2], [1,2]].

*Note that the sets in the powerset do not need to be in any particular
order.*

## Easy – Difficulty: Staircase Traversal

You're given two positive integers representing the height of a staircase and
the maximum number of steps that you can advance up the staircase at a
time. Write a function that returns the number of ways in which you can
climb the staircase.

For example, if you were given a staircase of height = 3 and maxSteps = 2 you
could climb the staircase in 3 ways. You could take 1 step, 1 step, then 1 step,
you could also take 1 step, then 2 steps , and you could take 1 step, then 2
steps , and you could take 2 steps, then 1 step

## Medium – Difficulty: Phone Number Mnemonics

If you open the keypad of your mobile phone, it'll likely look like this:

Almost every digit is associated with some letters in the alphabet; this allows


certain phone numbers to spell out actual words. For example, the phone
number 8464747328 can be written as timisgreat ; similarly, the phone
number 2686463 can be written as antoine or as ant646 3.

It's important to note that a phone number doesn't represent a single
sequence of letters, but rather multiple combinations of letters. For instance,
the digit 2 can represent three different letters (a, b, and c).

A mnemonic is defined as a pattern of letters, ideas, or associations that
assist in remembering something. Companies oftentimes use a mnemonic for
their phone number to make it easier to remember.

Given a stringified phone number of any non-zero length, write a function
that returns all mnemonics for this phone number, in any order.

For this problem, a valid mnemonic may only contain letters and the digits 0
and 1. In other words, if a digit is able to be represented by a letter, then it
must be. Digits 0 and 1 are the only two digits that don't have letter
representations on the keypad.

Note that you should rely on the keypad illustrated above for digit-letter
associations.
