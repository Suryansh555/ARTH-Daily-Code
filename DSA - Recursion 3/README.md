**Difficulty Medium: Lowest Common Manager:**

You're given three inputs, all of which are instances of an OrgChart class that
have a directReports property pointing to their direct reports. The first input is
the top manager in an organizational chart (i.e., the only instance that isn't
anybody else's direct report), and the other two inputs are reports in the
organizational chart. The two reports are guaranteed to be distinct. -

Write a function that returns the lowest common manager to the two reports.

**Difficulty Medium: Interweaving Strings**

Write a function that takes in three strings and returns a Boolean representing
whether the third string can be formed by interweaving the first two strings.
To interweave strings means to merge them by alternating their letters
without any specific pattern. For instance, the strings "abc" and "123" can be
interwoven as "alb2c3", as "abc123", and as "ab1c23" (this list is
nonexhaustive). Letters within a string must maintain their relative ordering in
the interwoven string.

**Difficulty Medium: Solve Sudoku**

You're given a two-dimensional array that represents a 9x9 partially filled
Sudoku board. Write a function that returns the solved Sudoku board. Sudoku
is a famous number-placement puzzle in which you need to fill a 9x9 grid with
integers in the range of 1-9. Each 9x9 Sudoku board is split into 9 3x3 subgrids,
as seen in the illustration below, and starts out partially filled.

The objective is to fill the grid such that each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid
contains the numbers 1-9 exactly once. In other words, no row may contain
the same digit more than once, no column may contain the same digit more
than once, and none of the 9 3x3 subgrids may contain the same digit more
than once. Your input for this problem will always be a partially filled 9x9 two-
dimensional array that represents a solvable Sudoku puzzle. Every element in


the array will be an integer in the range of 8-9, where a represents an empty
square that must be filled by your algorithm. Note that you may modify the
input array and that there will always be exactly one solution to each input
Sudoku board.
